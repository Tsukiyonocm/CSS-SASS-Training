    /* This font size makes things easier when using rem units throughout the rest of the site. For instance, 1rem is calculated as 10px.
    So if you wanted a font size of 16px, all you would need to do is set font-size to 1.6rem and there you go. This also means that you no
    longer need to change every font for mobile responsiveness, you just need to change this one setting.

    The 62.5% is based off what browsers typically have as a default size. 16px. By choosing this percentage, you set the default size to 10px,
    but it can be updated by the user inside of the browsers.*/
